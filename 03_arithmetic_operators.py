# Task
# The provided code stub reads two integers from STDIN, a and b. Add code to print three lines where:
# The first line contains the sum of the two numbers.
# The second line contains the difference of the two numbers (first - second).
# The third line contains the product of the two numbers.

a = 3
b = 5

print(a + b, a - b, a * b, sep='\n')

# print() has a possible sep argument that we can set to be a line break \n.
