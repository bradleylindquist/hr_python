# Task:

# Given an integer, n, and n space-separated integers as input, create a tuple, t, of those n integers. Then compute and print the result of hash(t).
# Note: hash() is one of the functions in the __builtins__ module, so it need not be imported.

# initial code:

if __name__ == '__main__':
    n = int(input())
    integer_list = map(int, input().split())

# -----------------------attempt-------------

if __name__ == '__main__':
    n = int(input())  # Takes an integer input, presumably the number of integers in the list.
    integer_list = map(int, input().split())  # Takes a space-separated input string, splits it into a list of strings, and maps each element to an integer.
    print(hash(integer_list))  # Attempts to print the hash of integer_list, but this will raise an error.


# ------------------------solution----------------

# Explanation and Correction
# 1. n = int(input()) reads an integer from user input. This is likely the count of numbers expected, though it isn't used elsewhere in this snippet.
# 2. integer_list = map(int, input().split()) takes a line of input, splits it by whitespace, and converts each split element to an integer. The result is a map object, not an actual list.
# 3. print(hash(integer_list)) will raise a TypeError because integer_list is a map object and cannot be hashed directly.

if __name__ == '__main__':
    n = int(input())
    integer_list = tuple(map(int, input().split()))  # Convert the map object to a tuple.
    print(hash(integer_list))  # This will now work, as tuples are hashable.

# input:
# 2
# 1 2
# output:
# 3713081631934410656

# ---------------what is this output?--------------------

# n would be 2.

# integer_list would be (1, 2) after converting it to a tuple.

# hash(integer_list) would compute a unique hash value for (1, 2).

# Since the hash function produces a different output based on the contents of the tuple, the exact output will vary depending on the specific integers entered by the user. Here’s an example of what the output might look like for (1, 2):

# 3713081631934410656

# This number will change if the contents of integer_list change, as each unique tuple has a different hash value.

# --------------------hash value?--------------------

# A hash value is a unique, fixed-size numerical representation generated from a piece of data (like a string, list, or file). Hash values are produced by hash functions, which are algorithms designed to convert data of any size into a fixed-size output, typically represented as an integer. Here’s how and why hash values are used:

# Key Characteristics of Hash Values
# 1. Deterministic: The same input always produces the same hash value.
# 2. Fixed Length: Hash functions produce a hash value of a specific length, regardless of the input size. For example, the SHA-256 algorithm always produces a 256-bit hash.
# 3. Efficiently Computable: Hash functions are optimized to compute hash values quickly, even for large inputs.
# 4. Unique for Unique Inputs: Ideally, different inputs produce different hash values, though collisions (where two inputs produce the same hash) can occur, especially if the hash function isn’t well-designed.

# Common Uses of Hash Values
# 1. Data Integrity: Hashes verify that data hasn’t been altered. For example, if a file is downloaded, its hash can be compared to the original hash to ensure the file is intact.
# 2. Data Lookup: In data structures like hash tables, hash values quickly locate specific items, enabling efficient data retrieval.
# 3. Cryptography: Hash values securely represent passwords or sensitive data without exposing the actual data.

# Example
# Suppose we hash the string "Hello" with a hash function. We might get a hash value like -2073233543. This hash value represents "Hello" in a compact form and will remain the same whenever "Hello" is hashed with this function.

# In the code you shared, hash(integer_list) produces a unique hash value for the tuple of integers, providing a compact representation of the entire list's contents.

# ---------------convert back?---------------

# Hash values are designed to be one-way functions, meaning they can’t be reversed or “de-hashed” back to the original data. This is a key feature of hash functions, especially for uses like data integrity and cryptography, where it’s crucial that the hash alone cannot reveal the original data.

# Here’s why hash values can’t typically be converted back:

# 1. Loss of Information
# Hash functions take input data of any size and produce a fixed-size output. For example, the SHA-256 hash function always outputs a 256-bit hash, even if the input is a 1 GB file. This means multiple inputs can map to the same hash (known as a collision), so the original input cannot be uniquely determined.

# 2. Security Design
# Many hash functions are specifically built to be computationally infeasible to reverse. For cryptographic hash functions (like SHA-256 or MD5), any attempt to reverse or find a matching input should take an unreasonably long time, even with powerful computing resources.

# What Can Be Done Instead?
# While hash values can't be converted back, here are some common techniques for working with hashed data:

# 1. Lookup Tables: In some cases, precomputed tables (like rainbow tables) of common inputs and their hash values can be used to “reverse” the hash by looking up common inputs. However, this only works for predictable inputs and doesn’t work well with unique or complex data.

# 2. Hash Verification: If you hash a piece of data and get a specific hash, you can verify data integrity by hashing the data again later and comparing hashes, but you can’t reconstruct the original data.

# In summary, it’s not possible to convert a hash value back to its original input directly. This one-way property is a key reason why hash functions are useful in many security applications.

# --------------ruby hash vs. hashing vs. python dict-----------------

# In Ruby, the concept of a hash has two different meanings, which can be a bit confusing if you’re familiar with hashing in other languages like Python:

# Hash Object (like a dictionary in Python): A Hash in Ruby is a data structure similar to a dictionary in Python. It stores key-value pairs and uses {} brackets to define the hash, like so:

# my_hash = { "name" => "Alice", "age" => 30 } #this is ruby code

# In this example, "name" and "age" are keys, and "Alice" and 30 are the respective values. Ruby hashes are flexible and can use any data type as keys and values.
# Hash Value (result of a hashing function): Like in Python, Ruby also has a method to get the hash value of an object. Ruby objects have a built-in hash method that generates a unique integer based on the object’s content, often used to compare objects efficiently or store them in sets. Here’s an example:

# str = "hello"
# puts str.hash  # Outputs a hash value in ruby, a unique integer for the string "hello"

# Key Differences and Similarities

# 1. Hash as a Data Structure: In Ruby, {} denotes a hash data structure, like a dictionary in Python, while in Python, {} represents a set. Ruby hashes are unordered key-value pairs, and you access values by their keys.
# 2. Hash Values: Both Ruby and Python use hash values (unique integers) for certain objects. In Ruby, every object has a hash method, similar to Python’s hash() function, generating a hash value for comparing or storing objects.

# Example Comparison

# Here’s how Ruby and Python handle these concepts similarly and differently:

# Python Dictionary and Hashing:

# Dictionary in Python
my_dict = {"name": "Alice", "age": 30}

# Hashing an object in Python
str = "hello"
print(hash(str))  # Outputs a hash value for "hello"


# # Ruby Hash and Hashing:

# # Hash in Ruby
# my_hash = { "name" => "Alice", "age" => 30 }

# # Hashing an object in Ruby
# str = "hello"
# puts str.hash  # Outputs a hash value for "hello"


# So, in summary:

# { } in Ruby is used for defining a Hash (similar to a Python dictionary).
# Hash values work similarly in both languages, but they refer to a unique integer representation generated by a hashing function and are not related to the { } syntax used for Ruby hashes.
