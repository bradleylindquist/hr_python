# hello world, first exercise in HR python

if __name__ == '__main__':
    print("Hello, World!")

# This Python code snippet is using the if __name__ == '__main__': construct to 
#     control when a particular block of code is executed.

# Here's how it works:

# if __name__ == '__main__':

# Every Python module has a special built-in attribute called __name__.

# If the module is being run as the main program (i.e., it's the script being executed directly), 
#     then the value of __name__ will be '__main__'.

# This if condition checks whether the script is being executed directly 
#     (as opposed to being imported as a module in another script).

# print("Hello, World!")

# If the script is run directly, it will print the message "Hello, World!" to the console.

# Summary:
# When you run this script, it will print "Hello, World!". However, if this code is 
#     part of a module that is imported into another Python script, the print("Hello, World!") 
#     will not be executed because __name__ will not be '__main__' in that case.
